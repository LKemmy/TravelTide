# TravelTide Customer Segmentation and Rewards Program

Welcome to the TravelTide Customer Segmentation and Rewards Program repository! This project is aimed at assisting TravelTide's marketing team in creating a customized rewards program by using customer segmentation techniques. By identifying distinct customer segments, TravelTide can tailor rewards and perks to match individual preferences and behaviors, ultimately enhancing customer engagement and loyalty.

## Project Overview

TravelTide, a leading travel company, is exploring the possibility of launching a rewards program for its customers. To make this program as effective and appealing as possible, TravelTide's marketing team decided to harness the power of data analysis. This project focuses on:

- **Customer Segmentation:** We utilized K-Means clustering to group customers based on their behaviour, preferences, and booking patterns. This segmentation allows us to understand various customer profiles.

- **Perk Customization:** By analyzing customer segments, we can identify which perks are most likely to resonate with specific groups of customers. This information sets the stage for designing a rewards program that truly caters to individual preferences.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Our analysis is grounded in data, providing actionable insights for TravelTide's marketing team to make informed decisions about perks, promotions, and marketing strategies.
